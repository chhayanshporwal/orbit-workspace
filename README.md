## 📖 Project Overview

Orbit Workspace is a multi-tenant, real-time project management platform that combines Kanban-style task boards, team collaboration, intelligent workload distribution, and workspace analytics into a single, polished application.

Users can create isolated **Workspaces**, invite members with granular role-based access (`Admin`, `Editor`, `Viewer`), organize work into **Projects**, and track tasks across a live **Kanban board** with real-time drag-and-drop synchronization powered by WebSockets.

> **Assignment Context:**  This platform was developed from scratch as a comprehensive engineering assignment given by **Navjot Kaur @ Softsensor.ai** (May 30, 2026). It demonstrates full-stack engineering capability — from database schema design through to Dockerized multi-service deployment.

## ✨ Key Features (Verified from Codebase)

### Authentication & Account Security
- **Email verification** via 6-digit OTP using the [Resend](https://resend.com) transactional email API (`services/email_service.py`)
- **Google OAuth 2.0** sign-in with automatic account provisioning (`routers/auth.py → /auth/google`)
- **Password complexity enforcement** — uppercase, digit, special character, 8+ chars — validated in Pydantic schemas (`models/schemas.py`)
- **Password reuse prevention** — checks against `UserProfileHistory` table to block reuse of current or previous passwords
- **Redis-backed brute-force lockout** — after 10 failed attempts in 10 minutes, the account is locked for 15 minutes (`routers/auth.py L253-L278`)
- **Device session management** — users can view all active sessions (device, IP, location via ip-api.com), and revoke individual sessions remotely (`/users/me/sessions`)
- **New device login alerts** — automated email notifications when a login occurs from an unrecognized device
- **Dual-storage JWT strategy** — `sessionStorage` for ephemeral login, upgradable to `localStorage` (30-day token) via the "Remember This Device" flow (`AuthContext.jsx`, `RememberMeDialog.jsx`)
- **Token revocation on logout** — JWTs are blocklisted in Redis with TTL matching the token's remaining lifetime (`routers/auth.py → /logout`)

### Account Deletion & GDPR-Style Lifecycle
- **30-day soft-delete schedule** — users request deletion via password or OTP verification; the account enters a grace period
- **Automatic task reassignment** on deletion — the `workload_balancer` algorithm redistributes the user's open tasks across remaining workspace members
- **Hard-delete cron** — `APScheduler` job runs every 24 hours to permanently purge accounts past the 30-day window (`main.py → hard_delete_expired_accounts`)
- **Deletion revocation** — users can cancel deletion simply by logging in during the grace period

### Workspaces & RBAC
- **Multi-tenant workspaces** with full CRUD and soft-delete
- **Three-tier RBAC** — `Admin`, `Editor`, `Viewer` — enforced server-side at every route
- **Invitation system** with email notifications, accept/reject flows, and re-invite for previously rejected users
- **Leave and delete request workflows** — members can request to leave; admins can request deletion (requires consensus from other admins)
- **Automatic task reassignment on member removal** — when a member leaves or is removed, their open tasks are redistributed using the Workload Balancer, with full audit trail

### Projects
- **CRUD with admin-only creation/deletion**
- **Project view tracking** — `UserProjectView` table records the last time each user viewed a project, powering "recently viewed" and unseen-change indicators on the frontend
- **Cascading notifications** — all workspace members are notified via in-app + email on project creation or deletion

### Tasks & Kanban Board
- **Task CRUD** with 5-level priority, due dates, and status tracking (`To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`)
- **Granular edit permissions** — task creators and admins get full edit access; assignees can only change status. Done tasks are locked and require creator/admin override to unlock.
- **Task reassignment with reason** — when an assignee changes, both the old and new assignee are notified, and the reassignment reason is recorded
- **Full edit history** — every field change is recorded in `TaskEditHistory` with old/new values, editor, and timestamp
- **Search and filtering** — tasks can be filtered by keyword (title/description search), assignee, and status via query parameters
- **Pagination** — `skip`/`limit` parameters on task and project list endpoints

### Smart Algorithms (`services/algorithms.py`)

**1. Urgency Engine** — `calculate_urgency_score(priority_level, due_date) → float`
- Computes a dynamic score from 0–100 based on priority tier (`High`=70 base, `Medium`=40, `Low`=10) and time remaining until deadline
- Escalation tiers: <24h remaining adds up to 36 bonus points; <72h adds up to 14; past-due caps at base+50
- *Time Complexity: O(1), Space Complexity: O(1)*

**2. Workload Balancer** — `workload_balancer(users_workloads) → user_id`
- Sums the urgency score of every active task per user, then selects the user with the lowest cumulative workload
- Tie-breaker: adds `0.1 × task_count` to prefer fewer total tasks when urgency scores are equal
- Used in: auto-assign endpoint (`/projects/{id}/tasks/auto-assign`), member removal reassignment, and account deletion reassignment
- *Time Complexity: O(N × T) where N=users, T=avg tasks/user. Space Complexity: O(1)*

### Real-Time WebSockets
- **Personal notification channel** (`/ws`) — delivers `workspace_updated`, `task_created`, `task_updated`, `invitation_received`, `member_removed`, and other events to each user
- **Project board channel** (`/ws/projects/{project_id}`) — syncs `drag_start` and `drag_end` events across all connected clients, enabling collaborative drag-and-drop with live "someone is moving this" indicators
- **Dead connection cleanup** — `ConnectionManager` automatically prunes failed sockets on send failure
- **User departure broadcast** — when a user disconnects from a project channel, a `user_left` event releases their drag locks on all other clients

### Analytics
- **Workspace analytics endpoint** (`/workspaces/{id}/analytics`) — returns total tasks, status distribution, overdue count, and a "bottleneck" report (top 5 users with the most overdue tasks)

### Audit Logging
- **Full audit trail** via `AuditLog` table — records workspace/project creation, member joins/leaves/removals, task CRUD, reassignments, and admin overrides
- **Workspace-scoped audit log endpoint** (`/workspaces/{id}/audit-logs`)
- **Global user audit feed** (`/audit-logs`) — aggregates logs across all of a user's workspaces

### Notifications & Email
- **In-app notification system** — stored in `Notification` table with workspace context, read/unread state, and auto-resolution on action (e.g., notifications about a workspace are marked read when the workspace is deleted)
- **Transactional email via Resend API** — used for: verification, password reset, new device alerts, workspace invitations, member removals, project deletions, account deletion scheduling
- **Graceful fallback** — if `RESEND_API_KEY` is a dummy value, emails are logged to console instead of dispatched (local dev mode)

### Cron Jobs (`APScheduler`)
- **Deadline reminder** — runs hourly, finds tasks due within 24 hours, generates reminder notifications for assignees (deduplicates within 24h window)
- **Account hard-delete** — runs daily, permanently removes accounts 30+ days past their scheduled deletion date

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 19** with Vite 8 build tooling
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** for landing page animations
- **React Router v7** with nested layouts and `ProtectedRoute` wrapper
- **Context-based state management** — `AuthContext` (auth, sessions, remember-device) + `WorkspaceContext` (workspaces, projects, tasks, invitations, members)
- **Custom toast notification system** — `showToast()` dispatches a `CustomEvent` on `window`; `ToastContainer` component listens globally and renders stacked notifications with auto-dismiss
- **ErrorBoundary** — catches React runtime crashes, renders a recovery UI, and reports the error to the backend via `POST /client-errors`
- **Custom `useProjectWebSocket` hook** — manages the per-project WebSocket lifecycle for collaborative drag-and-drop
- **API utility layer** (`utils/api.js`) — centralized fetch wrapper with automatic JWT injection, error parsing, and global toast dispatch on failure

### Security Defenses
| Vulnerability | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|
| **SQL Injection** | All queries use SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized bindings — no raw SQL anywhere in the codebase |
| **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** | Pydantic `@field_validator` on every user-facing text field rejects any input containing HTML tags (`<[^>]*>`); React's JSX escaping provides a second defense layer |
| **Broken Access Control** | Every route performs server-side RBAC checks against `WorkspaceMembership`; IDOR protection on `/users/{user_id}/workspaces` ensures users can only query their own data |
| **Brute Force** | Redis-backed `slowapi` rate limiting (5 req/min on login, register, forgot-password); account lockout after 10 failed attempts |
| **Token Theft** | JWT blocklist in Redis on logout; session validation against `UserSession` table on every authenticated request; tokens include a unique `jti` claim |
| **Password Reuse** | Historical password hashes stored in `UserProfileHistory`; bcrypt comparison blocks reuse of any previous password |
